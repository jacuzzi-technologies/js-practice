## Pre-requisites

Basic knowledge of Git is required.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

   `git clone https://github.com/jacuzzi-technologies/js-practice.git`

2. Open Terminal and navigate to `/js-practice`

3. Create and checkout a local branch

   `git checkout -b <your-feature-branch>`

4. When you are ready to commit your changes

   `git status` (to view your recent changes)

   `git add <filename> <filename>` (to stage changes)

   `git commit -m "a descriptive message" ` (to commit staged changes and include a descriptive commit message)
